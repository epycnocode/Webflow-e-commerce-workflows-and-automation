# Webflow E-commerce Workflows & Automation: Powering Up Your Store

Webflow's built-in e-commerce features coupled with its powerful Logic system make it a prime platform to automate workflows and streamline your online store. Let's dive into some exciting possibilities with code examples:

**1. Order Triggers:**
   - **Send order confirmation emails:** No more manual emails! Use Webflow Logic to trigger an email whenever an order is placed.
   ```
   HTML
    <wf-if for="order.created">
      <wf-send-email
        to="{{ order.customer.email }}"
        subject="Your Order Confirmation ({{ order.id }})"
        body="Hi {{ order.customer.name }}, thanks for your order! We'll keep you updated on its progress."
      ></wf-send-email>
    </wf-if>

   ```
   - **Update inventory automatically:** Avoid overselling! Reduce stock levels dynamically when an order is placed.
   ```
   HTML
    <wf-if for="order.created">
      <wf-update-collection
        name="Products"
        query="id == '{{ order.items.0.product.id }}'"
        data="{ stock: '{{ order.items.0.product.stock - order.items.0.quantity }}' }"
      ></wf-update-collection>
    </wf-if>


   ```
**2. Customer Engagement:**
  - **Personalized product recommendations:** Show targeted suggestions based on purchase history or browsing behavior.
  ```
  HTML
<wf-collection-list name="Products" filter="{% include recommendation_logic('customer.id') %}" />

  // recommendation_logic.js
  function recommendation_logic(customerId) {
    // Your custom logic to identify relevant products
    // based on customer data, return product IDs array
    return [product1Id, product2Id, ...];
  }
  ```
  - **Abandoned cart recovery:** Win back hesitant buyers with timely email reminders.
  ```
  HTML
  <wf-if for="cart.abandoned">
    <wf-delay wait="60" />
    <wf-send-email
      to="{{ cart.customer.email }}"
      subject="Don't leave your goodies behind!"
      body="There are items waiting for you in your cart! Visit [cart url] to complete your purchase."
    ></wf-send-email>
  </wf-if>

  ```

**3. Advanced Automation:**
  - **Integrate with third-party services:** Extend your workflows with Zapier or Integromat.
  ```
  HTML
  <wf-zapier-trigger event="order.created" data="{{ order }}"></wf-zapier-trigger>
  ```
   - **Connect to APIs for dynamic content:** Fetch updated data from external sources in real-time.
  ```
  <wf-api-request url="https://api.example.com/products" />
  <wf-collection-list name="Products" data="{{ apiResponse.data }}" />
  ```

**Remember:**
  - These are just starting points, adapt and expand them to fit your specific needs.
  - Test and refine your workflows to ensure they run smoothly and effectively.
  - Explore Webflow University resources and community forums for more inspiration and guidance.

By embracing automation, you can free yourself from mundane tasks, unlock new possibilities for your store, and ultimately offer a seamless and engaging experience for your customers. Go forth and automate!
